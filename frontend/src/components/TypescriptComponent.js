                    <div className="tutorial_question"><span className="question_no">1.</span>What is TypeScript?</div>
                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing, interfaces, and advanced tooling capabilities, making it easier to develop large-scale applications. Developers can catch errors during development and enjoy better autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring support.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>Key features of TypeScript include static typing, interfaces, classes, and modules. It supports ES6 features like arrow functions and destructuring and provides optional typing for better error checking during development. It also offers better tooling with IntelliSense, navigation, and code refactoring capabilities.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>TypeScript offers static typing, which helps catch errors early during development. It provides better IntelliSense and autocompletion features, improving developer productivity. TypeScript also supports modern JavaScript features and can target different JavaScript versions, making it easier to work with legacy systems. It enhances code maintainability and scalability in large applications.

                    <div className="tutorial_question"><span className="question_no">4.</span>What is the difference between "any" and "unknown" types in TypeScript?</div>
                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>The "any" type in TypeScript disables type checking for a variable, allowing it to hold any value without error. In contrast, the "unknown" type is safer as it requires you to perform type checks before performing operations. "Unknown" prevents runtime errors by enforcing type validation before use.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>In TypeScript, an interface is defined using the "interface" keyword. It is used to specify the structure of an object.

                    <div className="tutorial_question"><span className="question_no">6.</span>What are TypeScript's "type" and "interface," and when to use them?</div>
                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>Both "type" and "interface" define object shapes, but "interface" is extendable and better for defining object structures. "Type" is more flexible, allowing union, intersection, and type aliases. Use "interface" for object structures and "type" for complex types like unions and intersections.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>An "enum" in TypeScript is a way to define a set of named constants. It makes code more readable and maintainable.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>The "readonly" modifier in TypeScript is used to make properties immutable. Once assigned, the value of a "readonly" property cannot be changed. It ensures that certain properties remain constant throughout the program.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>TypeScript supports ES6-style modules. A module in TypeScript is a file with its own scope. You can export variables, functions, classes, or interfaces using the "export" keyword and import them into another file using the "import" keyword. This modular approach helps organize code and promote reusability.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>The "never" type represents values that never occur. It is used for functions that never return, such as those that throw an error or have infinite loops.
                        This ensures that functions with "never" do not accidentally return any value.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>Type assertion in TypeScript is a way to tell the compiler to treat an entity as a specific type. It does not change the runtime behavior but provides hints for the compiler.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>An "interface" defines the shape of an object and is purely for type-checking. It does not have implementation details. A "class," on the other hand, is a blueprint for creating objects, with both data (fields) and behavior (methods). Classes can implement interfaces to enforce a structure.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>Union types allow a variable to hold multiple types. It is defined using the "|" symbol. For example:
                        <code>
                            let value: string | number;
                            value = "Hello"; // Valid
                            value = 123; // Also valid
                        </code>
                        Union types are useful for situations where a variable can have more than one type.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>The "strictNullChecks" flag ensures that "null" and "undefined" are treated as distinct types. When enabled, you must explicitly check for "null" or "undefined" before using variables that might hold such values, reducing runtime errors.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>The "Partial" utility type makes all properties of an object type optional.
                        This is useful for creating objects with a subset of properties.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>Generics in TypeScript allow you to create reusable and flexible components by working with types as parameters.
                        Generics ensure type safety while enabling code reusability.

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>Decorators are special declarations used to modify or enhance classes, methods, accessors, properties, or parameters. They provide metadata about the class and are defined using the "@" symbol.</div>

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>The "abstract" keyword is used to define classes and methods that are meant to be extended and implemented by derived classes. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.</div>
                </div>

                <div className="single_question_ans">
                    <div className="tutorial_question"><span className="question_no">19.</span>What is type narrowing in TypeScript?</div>
                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>Type narrowing refers to refining a variable's type to a more specific type within a code block, often using conditional checks like typeof, instanceof, or custom type guards.</div>
                </div>

                <div className="single_question_ans">
                    <div className="tutorial_question"><span className="question_no">20.</span>What is the "unknown" type in TypeScript?</div>
                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>The "unknown" type is a safer alternative to "any." It requires explicit type-checking before performing operations, making it ideal for scenarios where the variable's type is not immediately known.</div>

                    <div className="tutorial_answer"><span className="ans">Ans -</span>Index signatures allow you to define dynamic property keys for objects. They are defined using square brackets to ensure type safety for such properties.</div>
